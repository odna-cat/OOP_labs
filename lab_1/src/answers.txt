2.2.5
- Takes the two numbers as input, and a character for the operator.
- Parses the numbers as doubles, and run switch-case for each operation. For division, check if divisor is 0. If yes, throw error.
2.2.6
- Takes input for which type of equation to solve on console.
- Input each of the constants. For first-degree single variable equations, both cases where a==0 and a!= 0 are handled.
- For linear system of two variables in first degree, this assumes the system is in form a11*x1+a12*x2=b1; a21*x1+a22*x2=b2. Solves using Cramer's Rule: calculate determinants and behave accordingly.
- For second-degree single variable equation, outputs discriminant. Assumes real roots.
6.1
- Returns the same option as if users choose "No" - You've chosen: No.
- JOptionPane.showOptionDialog(parentComponent, message, title, title, optionType, messageType, icon, options, init value)
Either modify Object[] options or int optionType.
6.2
- Scanner takes in input strName for name, int iAge for age, double dHeight for height.
- Returns values in console.
6.3
- Recursive printing of spacing and stars.
6.4
- ifLeap checks for leap year validity. Only affects February.
- Make list for each month, two lists of lists for months that have 30 and 31 days respectively. If input is in the flattened list, return values 30 or 31.
- February checks ifLeap then returns 28 or 29.
6.5
- Iterates through array to print the original array, the sorted array.
- Similarly iterates through array to find sum and average.
6.6
- double[][] emulates a 2D matrix.
- Adds sum[i][j] iteratively.
